# promptToReloadNumber
# Browsers automatically reload this app (its service worker)
# every 24 hours or more frequently. If needed, you may also
# prompt clients to reload a new version of this app by
# incrementing this number, then build and deploy. Then
# in Firestore console, change adHocDocs > appSummary >
# promptToReloadNumber to be the same. This will immediately
# prompt clients to reload, as soon as they are online.
